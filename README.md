CG model for myelin membrane

Model for myelin membrane (published in "Elucidating axonal injuries throught molecular modelling of myelin sheaths and nodes of Ranvier" Saeedimesine et al. 2021). See supplementary material for details on the bilayer composition. 
GROMACS (www.gromacs.org) input files:
* equilibrated myelin bilayer in GROMACS coordinate format (myelin.gro) and corresponding index file (index.ndx)
* topology files (system.top and top.tar.gz directory) for MARTINI 2.2 force field (from MARTINI webpage http://www.cgmartini.nl/)
* example of GROMACS parameter file (*.mpd)

Myelin model has been designed by Marzieh Saeedimesine and Alessandra Villa
